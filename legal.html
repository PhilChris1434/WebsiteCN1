<p>Because of Smile corp's unique commitment to fairness and justice, anybody from any walk<br>
of life is free to come to our team of legal experts to make a claim, file a suit, ask for<br>
advice, or just chill out! We are proud to say that in the history of our company, not a single<br>
one of the 4,654,342 lawsuits that have been aimed at us has ever been proven, and are clearly<br>
the results of fascists trying to smear the good name of our company. <br>The newspapers
that reported over 3000 cases of alleged corporate manslaughter against us have since found no<br>
evidence to back any of these claims up. Furthermore, our unbiased and trustworthy team of experts<br>
found that our glorious CEO buying said newspapers a day later had<br>
absolutely nothing to do with the journalists making such claims being immediately fired, and<br>
published a report on the subject which found that the journalists in question were responsible<br>
for "You know, like bigotry and bias and all of that bad stuff so dont listen to them. OINK!" </p>

    <p>On finding out that reports of toxic waste mismanagement in the local area are false,<br>
    Undungi, Wonbosi and Adama smiled with glee at the knowledge that the Smile corp power plant<br>
    located right outside their village will revitalise the local economy and bring jobs to their<br>
    impoverished region.  </p>
